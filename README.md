# Project Tracking Intro Component

This project is a solution to the [Project Tracking Intro Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/project-tracking-intro-component-5d289097500fcb331a67d80e) on Frontend Mentor.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://victorkevz.github.io/project-tracking-intro/).

## Built With

- React.js
- Vite
- HTML and CSS

## Challenge Instructions

Your challenge is to build out this intro component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The background pattern is also not provided as an asset, so you'll need to create and position it using code.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript required is for the mobile navigation toggle. However, you could also try doing this without JS.

Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
